Letter of Explanation for 2015 Notary Renewal
:
August 20,2015
To whomever this Letter of Explanation may concern:
My name is Conan Paige (formeriy Conan Woods). In February 2002 1 was in an abusive
relationship that resuited in me being falsely charged with Aggravated Chlld Abuse in the 3 Degree. i
was not convicted and Adjudication of Guilt was Withheld. Out of ignorance to the way law worked and
the influence of others, I took a plea bargain to end the nightmare of back to back court proceedings.
The downfail to the plea required me to plead guilty. I did what I had to do in order to get my life and
chiidren back. In the end, i took the plea and moved on with my life, applled and was granted a
protection order against my abusive ex, and eventually re-gained the custody of my children and my life
back.

Subject:
CORIAN L PAIGE,
Thank vou for choosing Notary Public Underwhters for all your notary needs. During our initial check, we
found information which needs to be corrected before we can process your request.
MORE INFORMATION NEEDED - On your notary application you have indicated that you've been convicted of a
felony. If this is correct, the Governor's Office requires a statement (in your own words) regarding the
circumstances and nature of the charges, a copy of the judgment and sentencing order, and a copy of your
Restoration of Civil Rights (or pardon). If any of these documents are unavailable to you, the Governor's Office
requires that you obtain a letter from the County Courthouse in which the offense took place, stating that
these documents are not available. These documents are required for all applicants, New or Renewing and
approvals and denials are decided at the time of each application. In addition, The Governor's Office has
become more selective in the review process, and documents submitted for your previous commission may
not be sufficient. Without this information your request may be rejected and processing could be delayed. For
faster service, you may fax this information to 877.856.1663.
Your prompt response will allow US to continue the processing of your order. Please feel free to contact us at

Letter of Explanation for 2015 Notary Renewal
August 20, 2015
To whomever this Letter of Explanation may concern:
My name is Corian Paige (formerly Corian Woods). In February 2002 I was in an abusive
relationship that resulted in me being falsely charged with Aggravated Child Abuse in the 3''' Degree. I
not convicted and Adjudication of Guilt was Withheld. Out of ignorance to the way law worked and
the influence of others, I took a plea bargain to end the nightmare of back to back court proceedings.
The downfall to the plea required me to plead guitty. I did what I had to do in order to get my life and
children back. In the end, I took the plea and moved on with my life, applied and was granted a
protection order against my abusive ex, and eventually re-gained the custody of my children and my life
back.
