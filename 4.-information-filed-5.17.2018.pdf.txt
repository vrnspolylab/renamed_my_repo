Certification for Deternflination of Probabie Cause
That Lachian Bu.chanan is a Deteetive with the San Juan County Sherifrs Office anci am familiar
with the facts anci circumstances cf this investigaticn in San Juan ccunty case number 18-540;
There is prcbable cause tc beiieve that Eric A. Kulp (DOB: 8/27/1973) ccmmitted the crime cf
Murder 2"'* Degree (RCW 9A.32.050) within San Juan Ccunty in the state cf Washingtcn.
This belief is predicated cn the fcllcwing facts and circumstances:
On 11 /29/17, Abigail Finney’s family called San Juan Ccunty Sheriff’s Office (SJCSO) dispatch
and requested a welfare check cf Finney, whc resided with her husband at 661 Blind Bay Rcad,
Shaw Island. Finney was scheduled tc jcin her family fcr Thanksgiving cn 11/23/17 but did nct
appear.
Family members received several text messages after the missed hcliday dinner frcm Finney’s
phene, hewever, they were skeptical that Finney had sent them due tc the centent and the fact
that she ncrmally had daily centact with her mether which abruptly ended after 11/22/17.
SJCSO sent Special Deputy Jehn Shannen tc check cn Finney at the residence cn 11/29/17.
Finney’s husband, Enc Kulp, AKA Eric Tubbs was heme and tcid Shannen she had gone tc an
unknewn rehab facility. He was unccncerned with her whereabcuts.
On 1/22/18, Finney’s famiiy requested an additicnal welfare check due tc the centinued lack cf
ccntact. SJCSO Deputy Ray Han/ey ccntacted Shannen and learned Finney’s family had
reperted a histcry cf dcmestic viclence incidents between Finney and Kulp, nene cf which were
reperted tc law enfcrcement.
On 1/23/18, SJCSO Deputy Harvey and Sgt. Herb Crewe went to the Blind Bay preperty. They
met Finney’s brether at the preperty whc tcId them that Kulp had threatened tc harm Finney in
the past. The brether aisc reperted that Kulp recently tcid .him that he had nct heard frcm his
wife. Deputies walked threugh the heuse but feund nc cne heme.
On 3/21/18,1 speke with Kulpis step-father, whc resides in Anzena. He tcid me that he was
speaking with Finney cn 11/22/17 when their cenversatien was cut shert. He heard Finney
arguing with scmecne and the phene went dead. He has nct heard frcm her since. They
rcufinely talked 4-5 times per day.
On 3/23/18,1 speke with the cwnef cf the preperty where Kulp and Finney resided. She tcid me
that Kulp sent her a text message cn 3/13/18 stating he had recently had a brief cenversatien
with Finney and she was dcing weil.
On 3/27/18,1 speke with Kulp’s mest recent knewn empicyer, Rcasaric Assisted Living in
Anacertes. The administratcr shewed me a text message frcm Kuip’s phene frcm 11/23/17 at
12:13 PM in which he stated his Wife killed herself eariier in the day.
On 4/5/2018i SJCSO executed a search warrant at 661 Blind Bay Rcad, Shaw Island. Deputies
iccated a bedy in a vehicie registered tc Kulp. An autepsy cn 4/6/18 cenfrmed the remains were
these cfAbigaii Finney.
Based cn the preceding infermatien there is prebabie cause tc beiieve that Eric A. Kulp (DOB:
8/27/1973) ccmmitted the crime cf Murder 2'’  Degree in viclaticn cf RCW 9A,32.050.
This declaration is being prepared and submitted to a court, a: prosecutor or a magistrate from
an eiectronic device that is owned, issued or maintained by the San Juan County Sheriffs
dffice.
Under penaity of petiury under the laws of the state of Washington, I certify that the foregoing is
true and correct to the best of my knowiëdge and beiief. Signed and dated by me this 11“' day
of Aprii, 2018, at Fnday Harbor, Washington.
